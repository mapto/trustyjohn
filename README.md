A game for the [Cultural Heritage Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/cultural-heritage-game-jam), using the mechanics of [Reigns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrERrdSze10) and [Lapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-owhIViyI0).

Work-in-progress [game design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w1eJTdvcJKE9bfqIMtB6Bz-RM-k4bFjmksxTEOHXFec) and [story blocks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N2TX5G59T9z6tlyIEbXTSZCaHk09DXstBK6leT2r4Mk/).

**You can also play a current version of the [wireframe preview](https://gamej.am/) or the [itch.io page](mapto.itch.io/fairytaleswipe).** Alternatively, watch a [walkthrough video](https://vimeo.com/648254108).

The first interactive story is based on Brothers Grimm's [Trusty John](https://www.grimmstories.com/en/grimm_fairy-tales/faithful_john) fairy tale.

Team discussions over [GGJ's discord](https://discord.gg/ggj).

One team member and idea are from the EU-funded [Values accross space and time](https://www.vast-project.eu/) project.

# Development

Due to the fact that the story is loaded dynamically and browser security, a local server is needed for development. To get it running you need to [install Node.js first](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then to setup the project, go to the project root directory (where this README.md file is) and run

    npm install grunt

Then you're ready to go. Type:

    grunt

And you'll have the game run locally and opened in the browser. Whenever you make changes to the code, the server will update it automatically.
