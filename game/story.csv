6,When the old King had been carried to his grave and when the time of mourning was over,narrator,kernel,It is time you should see your inheritance. I will show you your ancestral castle,10,,"I shall be faithful to you as I have been to him, even though it should cost me my life",10,
10,"You take him over everything, and let him see all the riches and splendid apartments, only the one room where the picture was he did not open. But the young King noticed that Trusty John always missed one door, and said: ""Why do you never open this one for me?""",newking,kernel,There is something inside that would appall you,11,,As you wish,16,
11,"I have seen the whole castle, and shall find out what is in there""; and with these words he approached the door and wanted to force it open.",newking,kernel,I promised your father before his death that you shouldn't see what that room contains. It might bring both you and me to great grief,14,,Okay,16,
14,"Ah! no, if I don't get in, it will be my certain destruction; I should have no peace night or day till I had seen what was in the room with my own eyes. Now I don't budge from the spot till you have opened the door.",newking,kernel,With heavy heart I must do it,16,,I will do as you say,16,

17,"When he had opened the door he stepped in first, and thought to cover the likeness so that the King might not perceive it; but it was hopeless:",narrator,kernel,,18,,,18,

20,Oh! who is the original of the beautiful picture?,newking,kernel,I have no idea,84,,She is the Princess of the Golden Roof,21,

22,"The faithful servant pondered long how they were to set about the matter, for it was said to be difficult even to get into the presence of the Princess.",narrator,kernel,,23,,,23,

24,"You have in your treasure five tons of gold; let the goldsmiths of your kingdom manufacture them into all manner of vases and vessels, into all sorts of birds and game and wonderful beasts; that will please her. We shall go to her with them and try our luck."" ",narrator,kernel,,25,,,25,

29,"""Perhaps,"" he said, ""I may bring the Princess back with me, so see that everything is in order; let the gold ornaments be arranged and the whole ship decorated."" Then he took a few of the gold things in his apron, went ashore, and proceeded straight to the palace.",narrator,kernel,,30,,,30,

35,They are all so beautifully made that I shall buy everything you have,princess,kernel,"I am only the servant of a rich merchant, his merchandise is more artistic and costly than anything that has ever been made in gold before",38,,What I have here is nothing compared to what my master has on his ship. There is such a quantity of things that they would take up so many rooms that you would have no space for them in your house,38,
38,Take me to your ship; I shall go there myself and view your master's treasures,princess,kernel,,39,,,39,
,# Sail back,,,,,,,,
39,"Then Trusty John was quite delighted, and brought her to the ship; and the King, when he beheld her, saw that she was even more beautiful than her picture, and thought every moment that his heart would burst.",narrator,kernel,,40,,,40,
40,"She stepped on to the ship, and the King led her inside. You John remained behind with the steersman, and ordered",narrator,kernel,Push off the ship silently like a shadow in the night,43,,"Spread all sail, that we may fly on the ocean like a bird in the air",43,
43,"Meanwhile the King showed the Princess inside all his gold wares, every single bit of it--dishes, goblets, bowls, the birds and game, and all the wonderful beasts. Many hours passed thus, and she was so happy that she did not notice that the ship was sailing away.",narrator,kernel,,44,,,44,
44,"After she had seen the last thing she thanked the merchant and prepared to go home; but when she came to the ship's side she saw that they were on the high seas, far from land, and that the ship was speeding on its way under full canvas.",princess,kernel,,45,,,45,
45,"Oh!, I am deceived, carried away and betrayed into the power of a merchant; I would rather have died!",princess,kernel,,91,,,91,
91,"I am no merchant, but a king of as high birth as yourself; and it was my great love for you that made me carry you off by stratagem. The first time I saw your likeness I fell to the ground in a swoon.",newking,kernel,,46,,,46,
46,"When the Princess of the Golden Roof heard this she was comforted, and her heart went out to him, so that she willingly consented to become his wife.",princess,kernel,,47,,,47,
,# 3 ravens,,,,,,,,
47,"Now it happened one day, while they were sailing on the high seas, that Trusty John, sitting on the forepart of the ship, fiddling away to himself, observed three ravens in the air flying toward him.",narrator,kernel,I will pretend that I don't notice them,49,,I'll hide and wait to see what they do,49,
48,TODO: How about having a story what happens if John does not listen to the ravens?,,,,48,,,48,
49,"The one croaked: ""Ah, ha! so he's bringing the Princess of the Golden Roof home."" ""Yes,"" answered the second, ""but he's not got her yet."" ""Yes, he has,"" spake the third, ""for she's sitting beside him on the ship.""",ravens,kernel,"It's my imagination, ravens can't talk",48,,wait and listen,50,
50,"Then number one began again and cried: ""That'll not help him! When they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet them: the King will wish to mount it, and if he does it will gallop away with him, and disappear into the air, and he will never see his bride again.""",ravens,kernel,I'm not going to listen to some birds,48,,listen more,51,
51,"""Is there no escape for him?"" asked number two. ""Oh! yes, if someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol that is sticking in the holster, then the young King is saved. But who's to do that? And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees.""",ravens,kernel,This is all nonsense,48,,stand still and listen,52,
52,"Then spake number two: ""I know more than that: even if the horse is slain, the young King will still not keep his bride: when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard, which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver, but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar: when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones.""",ravens,kernel,There's no way I believe this,48,,listen more,53,
53,"Number three asked: ""Is there no way of escape, then?"" ""Oh! yes,"" answered number two: ""If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire, and lets it burn, then the young King is saved. But what's the good? Anyone knowing this and telling it will have half his body turned into stone, from his knees to his heart.""",ravens,kernel,Even if it's true it seems to be endless,48,,wait more,54,
54,"Then number three spake: ""I know yet more: though the bridal shirt too be burnt, the King hasn't even then secured his bride: when the dance is held after the wedding, and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly grow deadly white, and drop down like one dead, and unless...",ravens,kernel,There's no hope in ,48,,got to hear to the end,55,
55,"someone lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side, and spits them out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows this betrays it, he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.""",ravens,kernel,"ravens, wait, tell me what to do?",56,,I need to think what to do,56,
56,"When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward, but Trusty John had taken it all in, and was sad and depressed from that time forward; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard, he would involve him in misfortune; but if he took him into his confidence, then he himself would forfeit his life.",narrator,kernel,Not sure what I can do,58,,"I will stand by my master, though it should be my ruin",58,
,# Interventions,,,,,,,,
58,"Now when they drew near the land it came to pass just as the ravens had predicted, and a splendid chestnut horse bounded forward.",narrator,kernel,,59,,,59,
59,"""Capital!"" said the King; ""this animal shall carry me to my palace,"" and was about to mount",newking,kernel,,86,,,86,
86,"but Trusty John was too sharp for him, and, springing up quickly, seized the pistol out of the holster and shot the horse dead",narrator,kernel,,60,,,60,
60,"Then the other servants of the King, who at no time looked favorably on Trusty John, cried out: ""What a sin to kill the beautiful beast that was to bear the King to his palace!""",servants,kernel,I remain silent,87,,There's something you don't know,68,
87,Silence! let him alone; he is ever my most trusty John. Who knows for what good end he may have done this thing?,newking,kernel,I serve in silence,61,,I know something I need to tell you,68,
61,"So they went on their way and entered the palace, and there in the hall stood a cupboard in which lay the ready-made bridal shirt, looking for all the world as though it were made of gold and silver.",narrator,kernel,,88,,,88,
88,The young King went toward it and was about to take hold of it,newking,kernel,,62,,,62,
62,"but Trusty John, pushing him aside, seized it with his gloved hands, threw it hastily into the fire, and let it burn",narrator,kernel,,89,,,89,
89,"See, he's actually burning the King's bridal shirt",servants,kernel,I shall remain silent,63,,I have a secret to share,68,
63,"Who knows for what good purpose he does it? Let him alone, he is my most trusty John",newking,kernel,"Thank you for the trust, mylord",90,,I can't hide it from you anymore,68,
90,"Then the wedding was celebrated, the dance began, and the bride joined in, but Trusty John watched her countenance carefully.",narrator,kernel,,64,,,64,
64,"Of a sudden she grew deadly white, and fell to the ground as if she were dead.",princess,kernel,,65,,,65,
65,"He at once sprang hastily toward her, lifted her up, and bore her to a room, where he laid her down, and kneeling beside her he drew three drops of blood from her right side, and spat them out.",newking,kernel,,66,,,66,
66,"She soon breathed again and came to herself; but the young King had watched the proceeding, and not knowing why Trusty John had acted as he did, he flew into a passion, and cried: ""Throw him into prison."" On the following morning sentence was passed on Trusty John, and he was condemned to be hanged.",newking,kernel,,67,,,67,
67,"As he stood on the gallows he said: ""Every one doomed to death has the right to speak once before he dies; and I too have that privilege?"" ""Yes,"" said the King, ""it shall be granted to you.""",newking,kernel,"I have nothing to say, mylord",85,,"I am unjustly condemned, for I have always been faithful to you",68,
68,"Trusty John proceeded to relate how he had heard the ravens' conversation on the sea, and how he had to do all he did in order to save his master.",narrator,kernel,,69,,,69,

71,"As often as he looked at it he wept and said: ""Oh! if I could only restore you to life, my most trusty John!"" After a time the Queen gave birth to twins, two small sons, who throve and grew, and were a constant joy to her.",newking,kernel,,72,,,72,
72,"One day when the Queen was at church, and the two children sat and played with their father, he gazed again full of grief on the stone statue, and sighing, wailed: ""Oh, if I could only restore you to life, my most trusty John!"". Suddenly the stone began to speak",newking,kernel,"If you cut off with your own hand the heads of your two children, and smear me with their blood, I shall come back to life",93,,"Yes, you can restore me to life again if you are prepared to sacrifice what you hold most dear",73,
