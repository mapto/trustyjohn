45,"""Oh!"" she cried in terror, ""I am deceived, carried away and betrayed into the power of a merchant; I would rather have died!""

51,"""Is there no escape for him?"" asked number two.

And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees.""",,kernel,,52,,52
52,"Then spake number two: ""I know more than that: even if the horse is slain, the young King will still not keep his bride: when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard, which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver, but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar: when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones.""",,kernel,,53,,53
53,"Number three asked: ""Is there no way of escape, then?"" ""Oh! yes,"" answered number two: ""If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire, and lets it burn, then the young King is saved. But what's the good? Anyone knowing this and telling it will have half his body turned into stone, from his knees to his heart.""",,kernel,,54,,54
54,"Then number three spake: ""I know yet more: though the bridal shirt too be burnt, the King hasn't even then secured his bride: when the dance is held after the wedding, and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly grow deadly white, and drop down like one dead, and unless...",,kernel,,55,,55
55,"someone lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side, and spits them out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows this betrays it, he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.""",,kernel,,56,,56
56,"When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward, but Trusty John had taken it all in, and was sad and depressed from that time forward; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard, he would involve him in misfortune; but if he took him into his confidence, then he himself would forfeit his life.",,kernel,,57,,57
